    <ul>
      <li>Under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and The Indian Wireless Telegraph Act 1933. The Madhya Pradesh Police is using various radio equipments after procuring wireless operating and CMRTS licenses from Government of India New Delhi.  

      </li>
      <li>VHF Communication: - District Headquarters are connected with all its police stations, and out posts with VHF static sets. Similarly armed police units while on deployment in districts communicate   with respective districts over V.H.F. communication made for these purpose, standing towers are being setup at each Police Station & Out Post. Besides this hydraulic masts also have been provided to each district Police Officers and staff are also equipped with V.H.F. Hand held and vehicle mobile sets.
    </li>
      <li>HF Communication:-  All District are directly connected with their Range HQ on HF communication.  Made all Range Headquarters & Madhya Pradesh Bhawan New Delhi are also connected with State Headquarters Bhopal over H.F.  now Analog H.F. sets are being replaced in phases with more reliable digital HF sets.
    </li>
      <li>ROIP Communication: - All GRP Police Stations & Out Post are connected with ROIP. GRP Police Stations now communicates among themselves with GRP Control room at Bhopal over Radio over Internet Protocol (ROIP)
    </li>
      <li>E-Mail:- All 51 Districts, all police station & all police officers are directly connected over Internet based E-mail message services for sending to State Headquarter Bhopal. All Districts are using M P Police Mail as well as NIC Mail.   </li>
    <li>Radio Trunking System: - To reduce congestion and provide multiple channels in VHF communication Network UHF based Radio Trunking System is established in big cities Indore, Ujjain, Gwalior Bhopal, and Jabalpur.

    </li>
    <li>CUG: - To improve and strengthen Police Communication and to harness the capacity of Public Network of GSM mobile communication, Government of Madhya Pradesh has sanctioned 50000 mobile connections (SIM) for M.P. Police in January 2014. Earlier there were 9410 mobile connections only. Another 20000 connections has been sanctioned to M.P. Police in 2017. Thus almost 70% of the police force has been added with mobile connectivity giving them cost free 24x7 connectivity all over Madhya Pradesh. Besides Government has also sanctioned all the DSP and above rank field and communication officers Broad-band data connectivity to enable them to harness the capability of Internet in their official work to improve efficiency.

    <h1>overview of radio models and their uses in percentage specifically in police headquarters:
    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Police Radio Systems:

        Police departments rely heavily on radio communication systems to coordinate responses, share information, and ensure officer safety. Here are some key statistics on radio models and their uses in percentage in police headquarters:
        </li>
      <li>Analog Radio: 60% of police departments still use analog radio systems, which are reliable but limited in their capabilities [2].
        Digital Radio: 30% of police departments have transitioned to digital radio systems, which offer improved audio quality, encryption, and data transmission capabilities [2].
        P25 Radio: 10% of police departments use P25 radio systems, which are a standardized digital radio platform designed for public safety agencies [2].
        </li>
      <li>Police Radio Usage:

        Here are some statistics on how police officers use radios in their daily operations:
        
        Dispatch Communication: 80% of police radio usage is for dispatch communication, including call responses and situation updates [3].
        Tactical Communication: 15% of police radio usage is for tactical communication, including SWAT operations and high-risk situations [3].
        Administrative Communication: 5% of police radio usage is for administrative communication, including routine checks and status updates [3].</li>
      <li>Understanding UHF Radios: Frequencies, Uses, and Differences from VHF
        UHF radios are an important tool for many industries, including transportation, construction, security, and emergency services. In this article you will learn what an UHF radio is, what UHF stand for, the different UHF radio frequencies and more! 

What is an UHF Radio?
UHF radio is a two-way radio communication device that uses ultra-high frequency (UHF) radio frequencies to transmit and receive signals. It is a reliable and efficient communication tool that is used in various industries such as transportation, construction, security, and emergency services. UHF radios come in many different types, including handheld portable radios, mobile radios for vehicles, and base stations.

What does UHF Radio Stand for?
UHF radio stands for ultra-high frequency radio. UHF radio frequencies range between 300 MHz and 3 GHz, making them higher in frequency than VHF (very high frequency) radio frequencies, which range between 30 MHz and 300 MHz.

UHF Radio Frequencies
UHF radio frequencies range from 300 MHz to 3 GHz, and they are commonly used for short-range communications. UHF frequencies are often used in densely populated areas where there is a lot of interference from other devices, such as buildings and other radio frequencies. UHF frequencies are also used for communications that require higher bandwidths, such as video and data transmissions.

UHF radios use a variety of frequencies, including:

450 MHz: This frequency is often used for commercial radio services, such as land mobile radio systems used by transportation companies.

470-512 MHz: This frequency range is used for public safety radio services, such as police and fire department communications.

800 MHz: This frequency is used for mobile phone communications and public safety radio services.

900 MHz: This frequency is used for industrial and commercial applications, such as wireless data transmissions.

UHF radios for land surveying are most of the time 410-470 MHz.
